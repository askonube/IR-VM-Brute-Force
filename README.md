## Incident Response: Virtual Machine Brute Force

### **Preparation**

- Roles and responsibilities for incident response are documented within the SOC team.

- Microsoft Defender for Endpoint (MDE) and Microsoft Sentinel are deployed and configured for endpoint monitoring and alerting.

- Staff are trained on incident detection, investigation, and containment procedures.

- Network Security Groups (NSGs) are in place but will be enhanced post-incident.


### **Detection and Analysis**

- An alert was defined to trigger for repeated brute force login attempts on the virtual machine `win-vm-mde` within a certain time period. In this case, it was 10 failed login attempts within 5 days.

- The alert corresponded to failed logon events from four distinct IP addresses:

- Login attempts were made using IP addresses from Poland, Russia, Ukraine and South Africa. It is not confirmed if the threat actors were physically located there or if a VPN, proxy server, or botnet was used. The IP address `193.37.69.105` from Russia is the most recent activity that appeared on our SIEM and it may have affected a Log Analytics Workspace Incidents diagram. This will be revisited shortly.

- A rule was created to monitor any suspiciously repeated login failure attempts. Specifically, the rule was to detect at least 10 failed login attempts within a 5-day window. The 5-day window was chosen due to the enormous amount of endpoints in the shared cloud environment. In such environments, brute force login failures may be distributed over time and across many devices. A longer detection window will help aggregate repeated failed login attempts that might be spread out, which will reduce alert fatigue.

According to Azure Sentinel documentation and typical behavior, it is indeed possible that if a brute force attack is ongoing at the same time as an incident and its detection rule are being created or updated, the incident’s interactive diagram might not immediately show all related malicious IP addresses. Several factors could cause this:

    Incident Entity Mapping and Timing:
    Azure Sentinel’s incident diagrams and entity mappings rely on the alerts and entities ingested and correlated up to the point of incident creation or refresh. If the detection rule was newly created or modified while the brute force attack was still active, only the alerts processed at that time would be included in the incident. Later alerts from other IPs might not yet be correlated or displayed until the incident is updated or re-evaluated

.

Time Frame of Top Insights Widget:
The Top insights widget in the incident details page shows data from 24 hours before the earliest alert in the incident to the latest alert time. If the query used to generate the incident looks back five days but the incident itself only includes alerts within a narrower window, some IP addresses might not appear in the diagram until those alerts are ingested and associated

.

Alert Aggregation and Incident Creation Logic:
Incidents in Sentinel are aggregates of alerts generated by analytics rules. If the analytics rule that detected the brute force activity was triggered by the most recent IP first, the incident might initially reflect only that IP. Other IPs’ alerts might be generated later and either create separate incidents or be merged only after a correlation update

.

Data Latency and Refresh Intervals:
There can be ingestion and processing latency between when events occur, when alerts are generated, and when incidents are updated. This can cause the incident diagram to temporarily show incomplete data until Sentinel completes its correlation and refresh cycles

Incident Summary

One virtual machine, `win-vm-mde`, was targeted by repeated brute force login attempts originating from four different IP addresses. Notably, as the alert was generated, the most recent threat actor was actively attempting to log in via brute force, triggering the alert concurrently with the incident creation. This timing likely explains why the accompanying graphic displays only one malicious IP address instead of all four.

A subsequent query was executed to verify if any of these malicious IP addresses successfully logged in. No successful logons were detected from any of the identified IPs.

Containment Actions
- The affected VM was isolated using Microsoft Defender for Endpoint (MDE).
- A full antimalware scan was performed on the VM through MDE.
- Network Security Group (NSG) rules were tightened to block Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) access from the public internet, allowing connections only from approved IP addresses.
- A corporate policy has been proposed to enforce this NSG lockdown for all virtual machines moving forward.

Closure
It is classified as a True Positive - Suspicious Activity. Brute force attempt occurred but was unsuccessful.
